# Online-Loan-Management-System-Using-MD5-to-encode-credentials-the-database.

Tech Stack: PHP , SQL, HTML & CSS

The objective of the project was to build certain modules on a Loan Management System, where users can apply for loans based on their needs online, instead of the traditional physical paper based application.

In this project, I built the User Interface for New user creation, User’s landing page and configuration files required for these User interactions. Details -
- Created a Sign-up page for new users using PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL . This interactive page
- Collects personal information from users like Name, Email,
- Checks the DB if the user already existed, based on the user’s email
- Add user profile is added to DB as a new record
- Encode the collected password using MD5 for enhanced security
- Created a Login page for the user to authenticate through use of Username and Password (already provided through sign-up process)
- Created the ‘Change Password’ UI for user’s to update their password
- Recommended future enhancements to improve the application to improve the interaction between the user and the bank. Automated SMS integration for status updates, better User experience to name a few

Through this project I was able to learn/understand
- The entire lifecycle of loan processing and the loan management system in the bank
- How automation made the loan request and approval process more efficient, by eliminating manual processes and reduced turnaround
- How automated solutions are scalable in nature to take up Business growth quickly with any enhancement
- How a modular system can help quickly adapt to changing Business requirements, and provide flexibility in terms of customisation and enhancements.
